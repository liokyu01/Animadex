# Animadex

This project comes from my idea of merging my interests in computer science and biology. In the same idea of a Pokedex, the Animadex serves me as an animal encounter register with different capture levels.
So far this project includes my encounters in Asia (Mostly Japan).
The informations for each species is described as follow:
- Category (mammal, bird, reptile...)
- Caputre Level (Picture taken, Observed, Tracks observed)
- A picture (500x500px) if taken or a pixelized picture (64x64px -> 500x500px no interpolation) if observed.
- 4 Naming references : Latin/Scientific Name, English, French, Local (Japanese for now, Might change depending on the country)
- Location(s) : One or several locations, if seen in many locations might only be "Japan" to avoid overcrowd. Locations are divided in 3 parts, Country, Region, Specific location (city, mountain, island)
- Notes: if some are given

# Todo:
- Better location display
- Finish to add all species
